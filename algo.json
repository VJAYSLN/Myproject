In other words, if there are more than 1 duplicated numbers, return the number for which the second occurrence has a smaller index than the second occurrence of the other number does. If there are no such elements, return -1. ~ Example ~ For a = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2], the output should be firstDuplicate(a) = 3.  There are 2 duplicates: numbers 2 and 3. The second occurrence of 3 has a smaller index than the second occurrence of 2 does, so the answer is 3.  For a = [2, 4, 3, 5, 1], the output should be firstDuplicate(a) = -1.","q_const":"Guaranteed constraints: 1 ≤ a.length ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ a.length","q_inp":"2 1 3 5 3 2","q_oup":"3","test_id":"t_First Duplicate"}
